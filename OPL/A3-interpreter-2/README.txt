I personally found that this assigment was very similar to Assignment 2, especially in terms of manipulating pre-existing
code to build upon the calculator language.

In this part, most of the work was centered around translate the parse tree into an abstract syntax tree.

Given the description of the ast_sl given, I was able to fully implement the necessary changes for 
the program to support being passed a single argument in the form of a parse tree generated by function 'parse'.

The in-class exercies we did helped me understand most of this, and the notes left in the source code
made it straightforward enough to kind of apply the same logic in necessary areas. 

// Part B 

I was able to get most of this code done when we did our in-class assignment. In that regard,
I worked with my team.

I couldn't exactly figure out the code for the expr case but the rest of the cases were either tested by us in 
the in-class assignment or provided by the source code.
